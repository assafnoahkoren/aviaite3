# Seed Data and Products Summary

## Investigation Results

### Current State
1. **Database Products**: There is one product in the database (`ace-787`) but it had no prices associated with it.
2. **No Seed Scripts**: There are no seed scripts or migration files that create initial product data.
3. **Manual Product Creation**: Products need to be created manually through the admin interface or via API calls.

### Actions Taken
1. **Created Seed Products**: I created a temporary seed script that populated the database with 5 subscription products:
   - Starter ($9.99/month or $99.99/year) - 100k tokens
   - Professional ($29.99/month or $299.99/year) - 500k tokens  
   - Enterprise ($99.99/month or $999.99/year) - 2M tokens
   - ACE-737 ($49.99/month or $499.99/year) - 300k tokens
   - ACE-787 ($49.99/month or $499.99/year) - 300k tokens

2. **Fixed API Response**: Updated the products service to transform the backend data structure to match frontend expectations:
   - Added `type` field: maps `isRecurring` to 'subscription' or 'addon'
   - Added `productPrices` array: maps `prices` array with `amount` field
   - Added `isActive` field: based on `deletedAt` being null

### Frontend-Backend Mismatch
The frontend expects:
```typescript
interface Product {
  type: 'subscription' | 'addon';
  productPrices: Array<{ amount: number; isActive: boolean; ... }>;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

The backend database has:
```typescript
interface Product {
  isRecurring: boolean;
  prices: Array<{ priceCents: number; ... }>;
  deletedAt: Date | null;
}
```

The transformation is now handled in the products service.

### Recommendation
Consider creating a proper seed script that can be run as part of the deployment process:
1. Add a `prisma/seed.ts` file
2. Update `package.json` to include a seed script
3. Document the seeding process in the README

This would ensure consistent product data across environments.
